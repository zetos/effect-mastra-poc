Right, let’s see what you’re really up to.

1. Present Situation — The Emperor (reversed): Control’s strangling the warmth. Rules, routines, or a stern mask are turning closeness into a parade drill. If it must be your way, it won’t be a “we.”

2. Challenge — Eight of Dynamism (reversed): The door’s unlocked; you’re arguing with the cage in your head. Let yourself out. Release the story that you’re stuck, and you’ll breathe again.

3. Below — Two of Questing (upright): Deep down you’re choosing a road: stay safe or step wider. You want a partnership that grows your world, not just fills the chair.

4. Recent Past — The Star (upright): Hope returned after rough weather. You remembered your worth. Good. Don’t misplace it now.

5. Above — Nine of Questing (reversed): Your mind’s building ramparts. Suspicion and stubbornness are keeping company at your table. Loosen the grip or you’ll dine alone.

6. Near Future — Ace of Pattern (upright): A solid new start shows up—practical, grounded, not just fluttery. Could be a dependable person or a concrete step that makes love real.

7. The Self — Eight of Pattern (upright): You’re doing the work. Crafting better habits, better listening, better choosing. Keep at it. Skill beats drama.

8. External Influences — Page of Dynamism (upright): Quick messages, lively talk, a curious mind around you. Others see you as sharp and alert—maybe a touch too wired.

9. Hopes and Fears — Page of Questing (upright): You want spark and discovery, fear being foolish. Curiosity is fine; just mind where you point the match.

10. Final Outcome — Strength (upright): Not force, not fuss—steadiness. Patience, soft hands, brave heart. That’s how this turns into something lasting.

Practical counsel:
- Stop trying to command affection. Invite it.
- Choose your path clearly; don’t keep two boats tied while you fret on the dock.
- Drop the paranoia; keep the boundary.
- Say yes to the tangible offer that builds trust over time.
- Show up consistently. Speak plainly. Be kind, and mean it.
- Courage first, then closeness. The rest will follow.
