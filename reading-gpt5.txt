Celtic Cross – on love, partnership, and the soft bits folk hide behind their ribs.

1) Present – The Emperor (reversed): Power games and wobbling boundaries. Either you’re clamping down too hard, or letting someone else run the show. Love isn’t a barracks, and it isn’t a free-for-all either.

2) Challenge – Eight of Dynamism (reversed): You’re not trapped, you’re just used to the bars. The door’s open. Stop telling yourself “can’t” when you mean “won’t.”

3) Below – Two of Questing (upright): Underneath, you’re weighing two paths. Comfort or discovery. You already know which one’s alive. Choose with your feet, not just your head.

4) Recent Past – The Star (upright): Healing and a bit of blessed hope returned. You remembered what tenderness feels like. Don’t turn it into a daydream you never touch.

5) Above – Nine of Questing (reversed): Stiff-necked expectations. You’re either bristling for a fight or refusing to bend. Walls keep out warmth as well as wolves.

6) Near Future – Ace of Pattern (upright): A real, practical opening. A date that sticks, a key on a ring, a shared plan with money and calendars attached. Seeds, not fireworks—plant them.

7) The Self – Eight of Pattern (upright): You’re ready to do the work. Good. Love’s a craft. Practice the dull bits: listening, clarity, follow-through.

8) External – Page of Dynamism (upright): Watchful eyes and quick messages. Someone curious, clever, a touch nosy. Talk straight; it saves a lot of sneaking about.

9) Hopes/Fears – Page of Questing (upright): You want spark and adventure, and fear being played by a pretty blaze. Fire’s fine—learn where to put the hearth.

10) Outcome – Strength (upright): Quiet courage wins. Not force, not sulks—steady heart, soft voice, firm hand. You tame your own storms and the bond settles loyal.

Advice (since you asked):
- Set proper boundaries: no thrones, no doormats.
- Make the choice you keep circling. Name it out loud.
- Take one solid step in seven days: a date booked, a plan budgeted, a truth spoken.
- Practice one skill daily: clear asks, clean no’s.
- When worry bites, do the smallest kind thing next. That’s real magic.

Carry the candle carefully. It’s light you want, not a house fire.
