Right. Sit up straight and listen. The cards have spoken; I’ll say it plain so you can do something about it.

1) Present — The Emperor (reversed)
Authority turned to muddle. Someone who should be steady isn’t. Either leadership in the relationship is absent, or it’s being used as a cudgel. Stability’s wobbling because control is misplaced.

2) Challenge — Eight of Dynamism (reversed)
You’re up against letting go. The door to freedom is ajar but you’re half-afraid to step through. The obstacle is accepting release from a victim mindset and the courage to claim new perspective.

3) Below (unconscious) — Two of Questing (upright)
Underneath, you’re weighing paths. Part of you is quietly planning, choosing which life to chase. The decision’s brewing even if you pretend it isn’t.

4) Recent Past — The Star (upright)
There was healing, hope, a softening. Faith returned a bit — enough to make you think things can mend or begin again.

5) Above (conscious aspirations) — Nine of Questing (reversed)
You’re thinking you must stand your ground. That turns into stubbornness. You want resilience but risk refusing the small compromises that keep love alive.

6) Near Future — Ace of Pattern (upright)
A practical new beginning arrives — security, a small concrete opportunity to ground the relationship. Could be a move, financial steadiness, or the start of building something solid together.

7) The Self — Eight of Pattern (upright)
You’re learning your craft. You’re willing to work at this: dedication, skill-building in love. Not flashy — steady apprenticeship of the heart.

8) External Influences — Page of Dynamism (upright)
Outside forces are restless and curious. There’s talk, ideas, maybe someone testing boundaries. Expect messages and mental energy; not all of it useful.

9) Hopes & Fears — Page of Questing (upright)
You both hope for fresh spark and fear fumbling it. You want inspiration and exploration — and afraid you’ll procrastinate or be too green to follow through.

10) Outcome — Strength (upright)
The end result leans good: patience, inner courage and compassion win out. If you do the work, love is handled with gentleness and steady fortitude.

Practical counsel (because prettiness without use gets you nowhere):
- Stop confusing control with care. Set firm, fair boundaries; don’t bully them into being “stable.”
- Let go where you’re clinging. Freedom can be a gateway, not a threat.
- Take the practical opportunity when it comes — stability builds love into something that lasts.
- Keep working at your craft: listen, steady yourself, show up. Courage plus kindness does most of the heavy lifting.

There. Now you know. Use it — or you’ll be telling your grandchildren about what might’ve been.
